UniversalGNFT Next.js UI Project

Welcome to the UniversalGNFT Next.js UI Project! This repository contains the user interface (UI) part of the UniversalGNFT project, which interacts with the Solidity smart contracts deployed on the blockchain.


Overview

The UniversalGNFT project aims to create a decentralized application (DApp) for managing and trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs) using blockchain technology. The project is divided into two main parts: the Solidity smart contracts backend and the Next.js UI frontend.

    The Solidity Smart Contracts (located in the UniversalGNFT backend repository) handle the core functionality of creating, transferring, and managing NFTs on the blockchain.
    The Next.js UI (this repository) provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the smart contracts. It allows users to view their NFTs, trade them, and manage their account.
